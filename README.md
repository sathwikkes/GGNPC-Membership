- A **proposed set of refined membership tiers and benefits**
- A **strategy document** outlining key opportunities, campaign ideas, and growth tactics

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Reviewed existing GGNPC data (membership tiers, benefits, join dates, expiration trends)
   - Researched peer nonprofit strategies for member engagement and growth

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Cleaned and analyzed membership data using Tableau [View Story Points](https://public.tableau.com/views/Golden-Gate-National-Parks-Conservancy-Member-Analysis/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
   - Created calculated fields (e.g., “Renewal Status”) to identify expiring/expired members
   - Segmented members by category, join year, and household demographics

3. **Strategic Review**
   - Created a SWOT analysis of the current program
   - Profiled key peer organizations and extracted best practices
   - Assessed gaps in benefit appeal, marketing, and data infrastructure

4. **Prototype Development**
   - Drafted new membership tiers using the MoSCoW framework
   - Designed supporting visuals and messaging strategies in Canva

5. **Dashboard Build**
   - Deployed an interactive web-based dashboard using HTML + Tableau Public
   - Enabled stakeholders to view revenue trends by tier and timeframe

6. **Final Recommendations**
   - Shared specific growth strategies across influencer outreach, member retention, and digital marketing
   - Highlighted the importance of streamlining communications and improving first-year onboarding

## 📊 Key Findings

- 87% of active members live in the Bay Area, yet younger and more diverse audiences are underrepresented
- Over 80% are aware of their benefits, but only 30% find them motivating
- January, May, and December are peak acquisition months
- Retail membership acquisition shows lower retention than online or direct mail channels
- Gaps in system integration are limiting personalized communication

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

- Refresh benefit offerings and tier language to inspire engagement and clarity
- Partner with micro-influencers and nature-focused creators to raise awareness
- Host more local events and pop-ups at community outdoor gatherings (e.g. SF Marathon)
- Invest in digital onboarding and retention tools (e.g. auto-renew reminders, monthly giving)
- Align campaigns with youth and education programming (e.g. “Adopt-a-Park” for classrooms)
